# Mackenzie Chapter 4

## What is research?

Providing credibility.

Three definitions:

1. careful/diligent search (like looking for files).
2. collecting information about a particular subject, like political surveying.
3. investigation/experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts and revision of
   accepted theories or laws in light of new facts. Theories are more general than laws. We have
   some laws, like **Fits Laws** - a model describing the time it takes to do point-select tasks.

We want to have a formal and standardized methodology for doing research in HCI - more
standardization. Empirical research encompasses experimental and non-experimental methodologies.

HCI research **does not prove** things. We just gather facts and formulate and test evidence.

Research must:

1. be published
    - Research must be published! Knowledge gained through research needs to be shared, to refine
      and extend the existing body of knowledge in the field. Need high scrutiny in peer-reviewed
      journals. Patents are also a publication - company can retain ownership and also make it
      public
2. use citations, work within body of research
    - Research papers use citations and references to connect papers together. Creates and connects
      a body of research. At the end of a paper, references are provided that provide the full
      resource, not just a brief citation. Citing previous work acknowledges that research
      continues, extends, and refines other research. Allows us to back up questionable assertions.
      More citations = more significant. **H index** is used to measure the impact of a researcher's
      publication record - point where rank equals the number of citations. quantifies research
      productivity and impact of a body of work.
3. be replicable
    - need to be able to replicate it. standardized method makes it easier, provide methods in
      paper.

Research vs design?

- Engineers, designers create stuff and work on products. Research is more narrowly focused. Small
  ideas are focused on in research, prototyped, tested, and advanced or discarded. New ideas in
  research are incremental, building on others. Research prototypes are early on - and won't appear
  directly in products usually.Prototypes should not be too finished - don't waste time making too
  perfect, or you won't benefit from feedback. Research is slower than design or engineering and may
  only be incorporated later. Researchers provide raw materials and processes for engineers.

## Empirical Research

Based on observation or experience - don't just follow existing theory. Should be capable of being
verified or disproved by observation or experiment - need hypotheses. Assertions should be narrow
and clear.

## Research Methods

### Observational Methods

observe humans interacting with computers. examples: interviews, field investigations, contextual
inquiries, case studies, field studies, focus groups, think aloud protocols, storytelling,
walkthroughes, cultural probes.

QUALITATIVE DATA - not precise but VERY RELEVANT.

directly observe in natural setting - not in a lab.

discover why/how of an interaction - reasons for behaviors - focus on thoughts, feelings, emotions,
attitudes, reflection, sentiment, style, approach , etc.

not many measurements - a lot of notes, photos, videos, recordings. Measurements are categorical.

### Experimental Method

controlled experiments in a lab.

QUANTITATIVE DATA - precise, but not very relevant.

Need two variables: manipulated and response variable.

- manipulated variable is shown to participants in different configurations. **independent variable
  **
- response variable is human behavior property that is observable, quantifiable, measurable. like
  time! something measurable. **dependent variable**

need to have two configurations at least. usability evaluation and user testing are not experimental
methods, because there is not a manipulated variable. A User study does typically involve multiple
configurations are tested and compared. Usability evaluation is usually just a single interface and
config, so not experimental.

Experimental methods still involve some observation.

Experimental methods, that are well-designed, allow powerful conclusions to be drawn. Cause/effect.

### Correlational Method

- looks for relationships between variables - quantification of multiple variables. categories
- data collected through observations, interviews, surveys, questionnaires, measurements.
- work in conjunction with experimental methods.
- balance b/w relevance nad precision. not controlled, but can connect better to real-life
  experiences.
- data is circumstantial - not cause/effect like experimental

### Observation

Either watching another human do a task or doing one yourself.
Manual observations - counting, taking notes, timing by hand the duration of activities. used for
pilot testing

### Measurement Scales

need to measure things, against a common scale - comparison!

Different Types of Scales:

1. Nominal - categorical data - assign a random code to category - license plate numbers, postal
   codes, job classifications, etc. mutually exclusive categories - the actual number assigned does
   not really matter. entities of the same class are equivalent - that is the only relationship that
   is vital here. used with frequencies or counts - # times for each attribute. most basic
2. Ordinal data - ranking/ordered. interval is not necessarily equal between points on the scale.
   cannot compute mean of ordinal data. more complicated than nominal, with rankings
3. Interval data - more complicated than ordinal data. intervals have equal distant intervals! no
   zero though. means are meaningful, but ratios are not meaningful. 20c is not twice as warm as
   10c. intervals are used for questionnaires (likert scale). responses should be symmetric w/
   neutral value. equal gradations between responses. might help to let respondents know that they
   should consider the rankings as equal
4. Ratio Data - most complicated/sophisticated. have an absolute zero and allow a lot of
   calculations. HCI's most common ratio is time! physical measurements like distance, velocity,
   force are ratios. counts are ratios. count per unit of time (bpm, mph, etc.).

### Research Questions

To generate research questions, check:

1. is it viable?
2. is it as good or better than current practice?
3. what are its strengths and weaknesses?
4. which of several alternatives is best?
5. what are the human performance limits and capabilities?
6. does it work well for novices, experts?
7. how much practice is required?

### Validity

1. Internal Validity - extent to which an effect observed is due to the test conditions. Captures the
   confidence that it is contained and due to inherent differences. or was it because of
   distractions, outside influence, etc.? high internal validity means that effect observed really
   exists!
2. External Validity - extent to which results are generalizable - outside the scope of the
   research/setting/context, can it be extrapolated and useful? representative of real world
   situations.

Internal and external are at tension, have to sacrifice one.

Ecological validity - refers to methodology (using tasks, situations, materials typical of the real
world), while external validity refers to the outcome.

### Comparative Evaluation

Rather than just collecting info about a subject, hci research should use an established condition
of a baseline - compare to existing, alternatives, etc. Comparison is important.

Benefits of baseline:

1. Check on methodology, know what to expect.
2. Comparison is possible with other studies.

## Relationships : circumstantial and casual

- look for and explain relationships - cause/effect often. variable manipulated is nominal-scale
  attribute of an interface (entry method, feedback modes, selection techniques, depth, etc.) and
  variable measured is ratio - task completion time, number of clicks, scrolling events, counts,
  error rates, etc.

- many relationships are just circumstantial - not causal. causal relationships just come from
  controlled experiments. need random participant selection, random sampling.

IF the variable manipulated is naturally occurring within every participant, cause and effect cannot
be determined. like gender, personality, handedness, language, politics, etc. = cannot be
manipulated.
