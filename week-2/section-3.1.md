# 3.1 Intro to Methods

We are always designing to better meet the needs of existing designs. We need to incorporate user
needs at every stage of the design process. Novelty should have a purpose.

## User Centered Design

Consider the needs of the user throughout the design process. Functional specifications should be
considered after the real needs of the user.
User needs are prioritized - and not known. They need to be involved at **every** stage of the
process.
The user needs to be asked and observed prior to starting a project, and should be checked with
frequently related to prototypes.
Users should evaluate the quality of a design.

Interact with users, understand their needs, and involve them!

### Six principles:

1. Design is based on explicit understanding of users, tasks, environments. Use this knowledge
   throughout the design process
2. Users are involved throughout the design process - they can give feedback, but also perhaps work
   on the design team directly.
3. The design is driven and refined by user evaluation. they get to decide
4. iterative process - constant iteration and improvement of designs
5. design addresses the whole user experience - entire ux should be considered
6. design team contains multidisciplinary skills and perspectives - computer science, domain
   experts, psychologists.

### Who are the users?

All three types of users should be considered when creating/refining designs.

**Primary Stakeholders:** Those who use the tool directly
**Secondary Stakeholders:** Those who interact with tools output, but not the system itself
**Tertiary Stakeholders**: Affected by the existence of the system.

---

In many jobs, the software engineers are often required to design the interface themselves.

There are a lot of new tools that allow us to have a new, different ux for old tasks! these are
products that create a major differentiator.

### How to have an effective UCD?

We need to know two things:

1. Who the user is?
2. How to integrate the user into each phase?

---

## Design Life Cycle

Four phases. Iterative process. even after launch

1. Need finding - who the user is? why they are doing the task? any context?
2. Design multiple design alternatives - different ideas about different ways to approach a task
3. prototyping - take the ideas with the most potential, build into prototypes and show the user.
    - might start with lo-fi
    - develop into hi fi
4. user evaluation - get user feedback from real users. then we start over

We are always gathering info from the user. need some methods!

### Methods

Feedback cycles are important to HCI. Based on the output of evaluations, we design more, then test,
then design more. try to make a better interface.

1. Quantitative data - objective comparisons, calculative. but is narrow view. provides the what? do
   after starting qualitative

2. The type of data we have determines our methods - we use the same types of approaches for nominal
   and ordinal - interval and ratio. rarely come across interval, ratio more common
    1. nominal - categorical - number of instances of different **categories**. number of people in
       each category.
        1. single nominal, multinomial (multiple categories).
        2. binary vs non-binary (y/n vs multiple options to pick from)
    2. ordinal data - specific order of answers for each category. we don't know the gaps between
       categories. (highly satisfied, slightly satisfied, not satisfied, very dissatisfied)
        1. single nominal, multinomial (multiple categories).
        2. binary vs non-binary (fail/pass vs multiple options to pick from)
    3. interval data - we know the specific difference between each category. the interval is
       constant between the categories. we don't know the ratio. no zero point either
        1. discrete - countable - whole number
        2. continuous - not easily countable, more exact - can inform type of specific methods
    4. ratio data - like interval, but has a zero point. we can use ratios to understand.
        1. discrete - countable - whole number
        2. continuous - not easily countable, more exact - can inform type of specific methods
3. Qualitative data - descriptions, observations. flexible. broader and more general. harder to
   generate formal conclusions. have to fight biases. sometimes we can convert qualitative into
   quantitative data. provides the why? do first!
   Typically determined by how it is gathered. it is a large set of possibilities.
   More expensive to analyze and prone to bias. can convert to quantitative for analysis.
   Code the qualitative data into nominal, quantitative data. We lose some of the rich data, but
   gain a numeric representation. Provides documentation and support for our data, by showing how we
   derived the quantitative data from the qualitative data. We need to maintain a mix!!
   Types:
    1. Transcripts
    2. Field Notes
    3. Artifacts
4. Mixed method - mix quantitative and qualitative data together to get a better picture of the
   results
