# 3.2 Ethics and Human Research

Milligram experiment, Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment, and Stanford Prison Experiment led to the
National Research Act of 1974.
The NRA of 1974 led to the Belmont Report - outlining ethical practices that research must follow.
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are responsible for overseeing research, if govt support will be
provided. Benefits to society must outweigh risks to subjects. Subjects must be selected fairly.
Rigorous informed consent procedures are required. Positive results need to outweigh negatives, and
participant rights need to be a primary concern.

IRB makes sure that benefits of studies are useful. Sensitive about participation coerced. Sensitive
about bias.

Need IRB approval to get approval to do studies.
CITI training is required. Then we can use IRB Wise after taking training.

Should know about the protocols:

- Starts with title of protocol and associated personnel, select each person
- primary investigator (faculty member) must be added first.
- protocol description - description, goal of study
- Protocol: methods of study - participant experiment
- data collection methods, understand participant requirements, benefits of study and risks
- plan for stats analysis
- start/end dates - separate data collection and analysis fields
- subject details - we are doing human interaction, so we need to describe subjects and data that we
  will collect. how many subject. how many genders.
-
    - are we targeting vulnerable populations - might need special considerations
    - number of subjects - want to make sure that we aren't wasting the time of participants.
    - inclusion criteria - who is the target audience
    - exclusion criteria - who are we specifically excluding from being able to participate.
- steps to protect vulnerable populations, their rights.
- describe recruitment procedures - how subjects will be found and selected.
- compensation? is there some money being given to participants?

can sometimes get a waiver (if subjects are not directly affected by research - like already
existing data that we will reanalyze).
simple observations that do not identify anyone could be waived also.
waiver of documentation of consent can be done for low risk research, where the waiver would be the
only documentation of participation. this is the only way we could identify someone
describe plan for getting informed consent - provide it at the start and make sure they know they
can withdraw. might need other things for other languages. check continual consent.
we want to get to implied continued consent.

Sometimes we need to deceive participants to get better research data - we need to indicate.
data management section - describe how we keep participant info safe and how it will be protected.

upload consent forms! can use the GATech templates.

usually 3 week turnaround time for acceptance of studies.

Private research does not require an IRB. Companies may do research on their users. A lot of rapid
ab experiments.

**Experimental Evidence of massive scale emotional contagion through social networks** - FB tested
out tweaks to news feed to manipulate user needs. They argue that it is consistent with their use
policy. Some people think that they violated informed consent principles. Coercion?

Might need separate principles and practices for industry research - a separate set of standards may
need to be created.
Facebook has their own IRB - they defer to a research expert. Companies are required to govern
themselves in the absence of legislation.

We should only:

1. keep respect for participants at the forefront - don't waste their time, respect their position
   in the design process.

## Emotional Contagion Facebook

1. In response to published articles, 61% respondents were surprised FB researched, 84% lost trust,
   and 66% were considering closing their accounts. FB issued apology.
2. Study wanted to test if repeated exposure to positive content on facebook caused unhappiness due
   to social comparisons. So FB modified news feeds and gave one group more positive content,
   another more negative, and one group with less emotional content. Found that users exposed to
   more emotional content were posting more emotional content, while those without emotions were
   posting less. challenged the idea found in previous studies that fb's emotional content was
   making people sad
3. Study brought questions about how to ethically conduct online platform-based research.
   This paper wants to see what people responded? what issues and considerations were important? and
   why were people so upset?

In analysis of negative responses, those with the most negative attitudes towards research are not
likely to be represented within research. how can we get their opinion? borrow from controversy
analysis and studies of mediated public reactions to avoid under-representing them.

### Theory of Analysis

1. Controversy analysis - mediated controversies to study issues - the responses to the mediated
   controversy of the FEC study allowed views about facebook and research to come into the light.
2. Expectancy Violation Theory - individuals have expectation about communicative behavior of
   others, and violation of expectations causes people to re-assess their knowledge and
   relationships to others. design choices and features of social media shape engagement and
   relationships. user expectations shape assessments about the experience of social media. gap b/w
   knowing that expectations have been violated and what those expectations are.

### Methods of analysis

- analyze and collect public comments on news articles - in this case, no need to separate public
  reaction from media coverage (it was mediated. or else we would have never known about it).
  comments reveal publicly important issues and capture reactions, sense-making practices to provide
  access to perspectives of people who may not use social media directly. addresses participant
  response bias - no limits on participation. broader sample.

### Data

1. Collection - public comments gathered on a set of articles related to the study
2. Analysis - did thematic analysis - what bothered people about the study

---

### Findings:

1. Living in a Lab - all research conflated into one category by commenters.
   -frustrated that no obvious start and endpoint for facebook research and did not know that they
   were being experimented on. even after knowing about the study as a whole, it wasn't clear if
   your feed was one manipulated.
    - lag in awareness - sense of secrecy and uncertainty about what is being done now.
    - lack of compensation.
    - even among those defending research - there was no thought about the value or purpose of
      study.
    - exploitative! lab rats.
    - public views did not consider harm vs possible societal benefit - people just focused on the
      negatives!
    - lack of transparency + power dynamic.

2. Manipulation Anxieties
    - opened people up to the idea that all news was manipulated on FB. manipulates the relationship
      between people. missing context.
    - manipulated the very user themselves - create a herd of docile consumers/mind
      manipulations/everything can be controlled.
    - mental health? could be making people sad - what if they were already vulnerable? suicidal?
3. Wake up sheeple
    - pre-existing negative views of FB confirmed - this is the way that the world and social media
      work
    - accountability shifts from FB to the users. don't use FB if you don't want to be an
      experiment.
    - shame others for using FB!
4. No Big deal
    - no issues. aligned with expectations for FB and businesses as a whole.
    - like wake up sheeple folks, they expected this and it re-affirmed their views.
    - manipulation as mundane - everything is manipulated! its just how it is.
    - like wake up sheeple - places blame on those who don't understand how social media/media/all
      communication works.

Commenters were surprised about the responses and attitudes of their peers. Norms surrounding online
platforms are not unified or settled.
Public relationships to platforms inform their assessments of researcher conducted on the platform.
FB has struggled with trust, so that's why there might be more negative views.

### Relational Approach

The relationship between users and the platform needs considered for research. Need a relational
approach.

The platform should be considered as a third party to social media research - and an important one,
because the relationship b/w platform and users precedes and endures beyond any given study.

- Just limiting consent/understanding to terms of service is not sufficient, because users don't
  read or understand them.
- View of ethical stakeholders should be broadened to include non-users, because even they have
  expectations in the platform and share their opinions. FB has broad societal impacts, so we are
  all affected by it. The expectations of non-users
  fold back onto those who are using the platform, and so we need to incorporate their perspectives
  to anticipate controversy, push researchers to consider the public benefits of research, and
  cultivate more beneficial relationships with platforms.
- We cannot get just one common view, but we should account for needs/expectations of different
  relationships with the platform - not just the official relationship, or users, or etc.
  Pay attention to the cultivation of informal expectations, norms.
- relying on the terms of service is not enough!! allowing opt-in might make it better and more
  positive. an opt-out option could also address some concerns, as they could just remove
  themselves.
  relational ethics is going to be the key - understand the variety of public expectations for
  platforms and use that understanding to inform the design and communication of research.
