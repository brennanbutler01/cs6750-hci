## Interaction errors

Focusing elements in pop-ups, selecting and moving text, and reviewing error pop-ups are frequent
occurrences in applications, and they often create problems for users.

For multi-input form fields, we are not usually sure if the application is going to advance us to
the next field or if we need to do so manually.
