# Section 2.7—Task analysis

## GOMS Model

A human information processor model, building on the processor model of a human.

1. Goals
2. Operators
3. Methods (made of series of operators)
4. Selection rules

Weaknesses of the GOMS model:

1. doesn't address the complexity of task and selections/operations.
2. assumes user is an expert and has these models in mind—not good for accounting for user errors
   or accounting for novices.

Strengths:

1. Formalize user interaction into steps that can be measured for efficiency.

### Varieties of GOMS

There are several variations:

1. Standard GOMS
2. KLM-GOMS - Keystroke level model - operators and execution times are summed to determine
   complexity.
3. CMN-GOMS - Sub-methods and conditions in a strict goal hierarchy - model how long each action
   takes
4. NGOMSL—natural GOMS language—good for human interpretation.

### Developing GOMS models

5 tips:

1. Focus on small goals
2. Nest goals, not operators - operators cannot be broken down anymore
3. Differentiate descriptive vs. prescriptive - what you can do vs. what you want them to do
4. Assign costs to operators (time)
5. Use GOMS to trim waste—visualize unnecessary sequences and simplify the tasks.

## GOMS to Cognitive Task Analysis

Human is an input/output machine. Processor.

Cognitive task analysis gets more in the user's head - paying attention to memory, cognition, and taking
a predictor view of humans.

## Task Analysis

Two views of psychology:
(GOMS - Processor) -Behaviorism emphasizes behavior as we can see
(Cognitive Task analysis - Predictor) Cognitivism—emphasize internal thought processes

## Cognitive Task Analysis

It involves a number of techniques and methods, but the information that we will gather is concerned
with the underlying thought process of a human when performing a task.

Sequence:

1. Collect preliminary knowledge
2. Identify knowledge representations (what types of knowledge does a user need to know to complete
   their task)
3. Apply focused knowledge elicitation methods—identify specific actions they will take, the
   knowledge they need, possible interruptions, the equipment, and sensory experience. ask users to
   tell us what is going on in their head
4. analyze and verify the data acquired. formalize and summarize
5. format results for the application

## Hierarchical Task Analysis

Large tasks are composed of smaller tasks. Smaller tasks might be used in different contexts.
Breaking it into subtasks might help us use our analysis in other contexts.

Helps us understand what tools might already be available to achieve a part of a task.

It also lets designers abstract over the process and focus on what might make their experience unique.

Abstracts out necessary details - modularize designs and principles—and organizing task analysis
to allow you to reason over it

## Strengths of cognitive task analysis

1. Emphasize mental processes - helps us understand the user's head.
2. Information is formal enough to be used for generalization

## Weaknesses of cognitive task analysis

1. Takes a lot of time to perform
2. Risk de-emphasizing context
3. Ill-suited for novices

## Other task analysis frameworks

Human information processor models (KLM, TLM, MHP, CPM-GOMS, NGOMSL)

Cognitive models (CDM - Critical decision method, TKS-task knowledge structures, CFM-cognitive function model, applied CTA, skill-based CTA)
