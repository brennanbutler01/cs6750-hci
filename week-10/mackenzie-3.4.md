## Mental models and metaphor

People take longer and commit more errors if there is physical misalignment between displays and
controls, or poor mapping that obfuscates the controls and their effects.

Mental models are common in HCI, and metaphors/physical analogies help us. These are __conceptual
models__.

__Implementation models__ should be avoided. These are systems that impose a set of interactions to
follow the workings of the application.
