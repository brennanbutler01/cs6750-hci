# Heuristic Evaluation

For the heuristic evaluation finding, I originally intended to look at just three heuristics
across several interfaces.

However, the diversity of quality interfaces for generating personalized travel packing lists is
rather limited, and many
applications require fees or have limited functionality. Because of this, I am going to just
dive deep into PackPoint, which seems to be the most quality of the applications.

--

1. **Visibility of System Status**:
   The app does a nice job of letting you know when it is loading. After selecting activities and
   asking the application to generate the list, it does provide helpful loading indicators and
   states
   what is happening.

At the top of the activity page, there is a helpful page title that makes it clear that you have
advanced to selecting activities.

When items are added or removed, visual indications are provided, but it might be helpful to support
other modalities like haptic feedback, sound, or something else.

It does not make it clear enough when you are done with your packing list. It is in a perpetual
state of allowing modifications, which makes it hard to understand the system status.

2. **Match Between System and the Real World**:
   Some of the labels, like on the Activities page, there is a checkbox you can press for _Repeat
   Basics_ and that does not provide a great mapping between the real world. What are the basics?

Additionally, they don't always provide the clearest labels to allow users to create solid
representations and could leverage some helpful tooltips at times to provide more information to
users.

The entry and visual appearance of list items for packing could be improved, as it currently just
relies on a list interface that appears like any note-taking application. It would be better if
there was a connection to suitcases, luggage, etc. within the interface. Some sort of zipping noises
or packing sounds, or perhaps some way to allow for more haptic feedback on the device could improve
the connection to the real world.

3. **User Control and Freedom**:
   PackPoint does make it quite easy to undo actions, go back in the trip creation flow, and delete
   things that were selected or added in error.

However, the controls to do this are sometimes nested in menus, and the application does not make
great use of signifiers to make users aware of affordances.

Navigation is confusing and obfuscated. It took me a long time to figure out how to navigate between
different trips that I created, and there was a lack of affordances.

Also, when creating a trip taking place in the past, the trip immediately is hidden and goes into
archive—have to then go to settings to navigate to the archived trips. It was very confusing and
prone to error.

User control and freedom could be bolstered with voice controls, with a more prominent, non-nested
navigation bar.

4. **Consistency and Standards**:
   Features are consistent throughout PackPoint, because of the limited feature-set.

There is not a floating action button like on many other android apps.

5. **Error Prevention**:
   There was a lack of error prevention possibilities in terms of recommended items or
   anything like that. I didn't see it tell me or yell at me if I was going to take far too little.
   It
   just used my selected activities as a starting point, so I think it could prevent some user
   errors
   better that way.

When deleting something, there is a popup confirmation—but it did not feel very helpful, more just
annoying

I would like to know if I was missing important things or something that i packed before, or had
deleted something previously that seems necessary and for these types of warnings to be configurable

6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall**:
   This is perhaps the heuristic that PackPoint has achieved best. The application does a fantastic
   job
   of
   providing a list of regular items that would be useful depending on the types of activities that
   will be undertaken.

Users are able to focus on the task at hand and worry less about adding mundane, routine items over
and over.

PackPoint could be better by providing some additional reminders or recommendations and checking if
things had been deleted or removed that could be required or that personal history indicated might
be necessary.

When adding new items, it would be helpful if there were additional suggestions made to reduce
cognitive loads, maybe using AI.

7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**:
   PackPoint does appear to offer some customization settings for users that pay.

They provide the ability to create custom activities and to make templates for packing.

However, the interface does not provide shortcuts to allow users to customize their workflow or
editing.

There was no ability to customize the deletion process, to simplify adding or removing items, etc.

I think a set of custom shortcuts to make this quicker or some way to allow even non-paying users to
automate this process if they so chose would provide better differentiation by skill.

There's no ability to use voice commands to enter items or to shake to delete.

8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**:
   The design within the application is quite consistent and minimalist, with clutter kept to a
   minimum
   in most cases.

However, pages tend to lack search features and require heavy amounts of scrolling. I think there is
more that could be done to emulate both the feel of a physical check-list and to prevent users of
the application from excessively scrolling.

The minimalism of the final packing page (where you can add or remove items from your list) is
overdone even, and could benefit from a little more flair and differentiation. There is a lack of
contrast overall, and my focus gets lost in the gray, boring page.

9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**:
   I did not notice any errors at all when using the application, which may speak good to design, or
   could point to the fact that something was going wrong silently.

When deleting something (if in error), there is not an easy undo button or history of actions taken,
so it makes it hard to recover from errors in selection gracefully. I think a history section,
similar to GIT history, could
help users recover from their own errors that they make.

10. **Help and Documentation**:
    There does not appear to be any help documentation readily available for PackPoint within the
    interface, nor is there a FAQ or other section for making information easily available to users.

Even in settings or on their website, there is not a great place to find more information about the
application or what things do in the interface.
