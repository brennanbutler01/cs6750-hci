# Process of Interaction Design

## Interaction Design - What is it?

Design is the drafting of a plan to ultimately be executed. Need knowledge of target domain. Investigate the domain
through **UCD**. Need to consider many designs.

Build prototypes that users can interact with, sketches also.

Interaction design is developing a plan informed by product's intended use, target domain, and considerations. Ideas
need generated, captured, and evaluated by users and must be presented to them in a form with which they can interact.

## Four basic activities of interaction design

1. identifying needs and establishing requirements - who are users are and what their use needs are
2. developing alternative designs - two stages
    1. conceptual design - producing conceptual model for product - what it should do, behave, look like
    2. physical design - colors, sounds, images, menu design selected
3. building interactive prototypes so they can be communicated and assessed
4. evaluating them

## Three Characteristics of Interaction Design Process

1. User Focus - provide opportunities for evaluation and feedback
2. Specific Usability criteria - ux goals should be documented and agreed upon. use to evaluate and check progress
3. Iteration - refine design from feedback

## Identifying Users

1. Primary Users - hands-on users of the systems
2. Secondary users - occasional users or those who use through an intermediary
3. Tertiary users - those affected by the introduction of the system or influence its purchase.

There are also stakeholders who have just any stake in the development. Stakeholders includes the development team,
managers, users, recipients of output, etc.

## Identifying Needs

Get the needs from the real users.

Understand existing behavior.

## Generating Alternative Designs

Alternative designs come from reviewing existing, alternative designs and drawing inspiration from them with help from
own experience and other designs.
Deliberately seeking out sources of information.

## Selecting among alternative designs

Divide the decisions into those visible to the user and those internal.

Can use documentation to communicate the design, or prototype.

Use the way in which users will interact with the product as the driving force behind the design. FOCUS on the
externally visible behaviors.

Prototyping to overcome misunderstandings. Gives a better understanding of the product user experience.

Everyone has different views of quality, os need to work to define requirements for each product. Understand and clarify
stakeholder expectations to provide benchmarks against which measurement can be possible and facilitate choosing between
alternatives.

Write down measurable usability criteria. __Usability engineering__.

## Usability Engineering

Finding measurable criteria to evaluate products and determining where they fall within the matrix. Some criteria:

1. Effectiveness - does the system do what it needs?
2. Efficiency - Does it make it quick and easy?
3. Safety - is it easy and does it gracefully handle failures?
4. Utility - are tasks easy to do and promote productivity?
5. Learnability - how long does it take to learn the system?
6. Memorability - how long is it to remember how to use the system after a period of time away?

## Lifecycle Models

Captures different activities and how they are related. Get a view of the development effort.

Microsoft uses sync and stabilize.

1. Planning phase - product vision, specifications, schedule
    - Vision statement that uses customer input to identify / order features
    - Specification document - feature functionality, architectural issues, component interdependencies
    - Schedule and team formation
2. Development phase - 3 or 4 sequential subprojects with milestone releases
    - 1/3, 2/3, 3/3 starting with the most critical features done first
3. Stabilization Phase - internal and external testing, ship
    - Internal testing within company
    - External company with BETA sites
    - Release preparation - prepare release
    - disks and documentations

Life cycle model

1. Identify requirements and needs
2. Alternative designs created
3. Interactive versions of designs are developed and evaluated
4. May need to return to needs or requirement finding. or back to redesigning

Final product emerges in an evolutionary fashion - developed from rough idea to finished product.

## Software Lifecycles

### Waterfall

Linear model. Each step must be finished before the next begins.

Requirements may change over time, but this is a linear model and not flexible. No opportunity to review and evaluate
with users.

**Linear** with intendned functionality driving the development.

1. Requirement Analysis
2. Design
3. Code
4. Test
5. Maintain

### Spiral Lifecycle

Risk analysis and prototyping. **Iterative** model. Each iteration may be based on a different lifecycle model and may
have different activities.

Need to identify and control risks is responsible for the spiral, not intended functionality.

WinWin spirals include stakeholder identification and their respective win conditions - with the requirement that win-win scenarios are found.

### Rapid Application Development (RAD)

**User centered** and flexible for changing requirements.

Features
1. Time-limited cycles of six months - each with a partial system. Time-boxed. Break the project into smaller chunks.
2. JAD - Joint application development with users and developers coming together in workshops.

Five phases:
1. Project set-up
2. JAD workshops 
3. Iterative design and build
4. Engineer and test final prototypes
5. Implementation review

DSDM - Dynamic Systems Development Method attempts to standardize. Main principle is user involvement.

Five stages:
1. Feasibility Study
2. Business Study
3. Functional model iteration
4. Design and build iteration
5. Implementation


## Lifecycle Models in HCI

### Star Lifecycle Model
1. Analytic mode of activity - top-down, organizing, judicial, formal, from system view towards user view
2. Synthetic mode - bottom-up, free-thinking, creative, ad-hoc from user view towards system view

Activities are not ordered and are highly interconnected. You can move from any to another.

Evaluation is always required.

1. Requirements/Specification
2. Task Analysis / Functional analysis
3. Conceptual Design/ formal design/ representation
4. Prototyping
5. Implementation
6. Evaluation

### Usability Engineering Lifecycle

Holistic view of usability engineering and how to perform the tasks required. Specifies the integration of usability tasks into software lifecycles.

Three tasks:
1. Requirements Analysis - set of usability goals in a style guide. Style guide is used to capture and disseminate the usability goals of the project.
2. Design/testing/development
3. Installation.
