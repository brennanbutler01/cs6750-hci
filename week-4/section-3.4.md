# Section 3.4 - Design Alternatives

After need-finding, we do design alternatives. Brainstorm how to accomplish our task.

## Design Mistakes

Two biggest design mistakes:

1. Jump to design without understanding users/task.
2. Stick too close to existing designs and don't consider full range.
    - Distance yourself from existing solutions.
    - Flesh things out more, it will make you better.

## Design Space

- Problem space: define as far away as possible from the interface for currently doing it.
- Design space: The area in which we design our solution. Explore all the possible design space.
  Brainstorm a large space.

## Individual Brainstorming

It is often best when you do this by yourself. Groups coalesce around ideas too early.

Generate a lot of ideas. Write down everything.
How to design for different types of interactions? different interfaces? different audiences?

5 tips:

1. Write down the core problem. Stay grounded in the problem.
2. Constrain yourself. One idea in a number of categories. Include non-traditional or impossible
   ideas.
3. Aim for 20 different ideas.
4. Take a break during brainstorming.
5. Divide and conquer - small problems are easy to brainstorm, so break into chunks.

## Group Brainstorming

4 behaviors that block progress:

1. Social loafing - people don't work hard in groups as they do individually.
2. Conformity - groups tend to want to agree and results in convergent thinking. discourages
   diversity of ideas. we really want **divergent thinking**.
3. Production blocking - some people dominate the conversation and the weight of ideas.
4. Performance Matching - can lose momentum overtime.
5. Power dynamics - biases and potential to defer to senior thinkers.

How to combat group brainstorming challenges?

1. Expressiveness - any idea that comes to mind should be shared.
2. Non-evaluation - no criticizing ideas.
3. Quantity - brainstorm as many ideas as possible.
4. Building - build on others ideas.
5. Stay focused - keep goal in mind.
6. No explaining - no justifying or explaining.
7. Revisit the problem often - say the problem aloud when you have problems.
8. Encourage others - ask others to speak up.

5 tips

1. Go through every individual ideas - bring individual brainstorming results to the group and go
   through each one.
2. Find the optimal size - not too many or too few people. no more than 5 people. if you need more,
   do intermediary groups.
3. Clear communication rules. Set a timer for people talking.
4. Set clear expectations - state the session goals and finishing criteria.
5. End with ideas - don't decide on one idea. End with several ideas, let them percolate and then
   revisit.

## Fleshing out design ideas

After brainstorming, it helps to pick a couple of ideas that are best and move forward with fleshing
out the stubs.

### Personas

Create characters to represent our users. Give names, dates, details. Simulate their thoughts,
interruptions, things they like, dislike, habits.

Create 3-4 different personas. Each should be different people representing different elements of
our task, the full range of people that we care about.

We want to emphasize with each persona.

### User Profiles

While personas give us a small number of characters, we might want more peoples.

Define variables for users and possibilities within each. Things like experience, skill,
motivation, tech literacy, usage frequency, etc.

Frequent users want efficiency, infrequent users need discoverability.

Cannot design for everyone. but need to design for the actual users.


### Timelines

Stretch persona over time. Journey maps (but narrower).

Analyze initial motivations for starting the task, and see what they do next.

What actions lead up to the task and how are they feeling? How would each design decision influence
their experience?

### Scenarios/Storyboards

Storyboards. Identify what is going to happen in a particular scenario.

Specific person interacting in a specific way with specific coming up.

Storyboards can be a demonstration/mockup of how to use the finished product.

### User Modeling

How does a user achieve each of their goals in each interface? Each alternative? Do cognitive
analysis to understand what they are thinking about.

Unlike personas, which are personal and designed for empathy, user modeling is objective and
intended to be measurable.
