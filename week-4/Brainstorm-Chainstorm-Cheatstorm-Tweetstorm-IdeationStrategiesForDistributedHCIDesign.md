# Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: New Ideation Strategies for Distributed HCI Design

**Cheatstorming** - Previously generated brainstorm ideas are delivered to targeted local contexts without the need for
imaginative ideation.

**Ideation** - Radical redistribution of ideas to unconventionalize a given context.

Brainstorming has less to do with the creation of novel ideas, and more to do with its cultural influence on the
ideating team.

## Brainstorming

Obsborn's three phases of brainstorming:

1. Fact-Finding - Problem-definition and preparation.
2. Idea-Finding - Idea-production and idea-development. Select and combine tentative ideas.
3. Solution-Finding - Evaluation and adoption. Verifying offered solution and implementing a final set.

Brainstorming might be less effective than individual idea generation.

Obsorn's guidelines and rules were intended to make brainstorming more effective for groups, and includes principles
like going wild with ideas and avoiding judging ideas.

Brainstorming might just be a supplement to individual ideation and not a replacement.

### Brainstorming Limitations

1. Production Blocking - only one person speaks at a time. Ideas are suppressed or forgotten later. Listening to others'
   ideas might distract thought process and ability to record their own ideas.
2. Evaluation Apprehension - fear of being criticized might lead people to participate less.
3. free riding - motivation to work decreases because of the lack of feedback and recognition.

### Structuring Ideation

Context is required because just simply looking at brainstorming empirically is not enough. It is important for team
building and takes into consideration rules, culture, problem space, etc.

Can use oblique strategies, random input, etc. to generate novel ideas.

#### Social Configurations of Idea Generation Behavior

1. Face-to-face brainstorming - 15 to 45-minute sessions led by brainstorming expert to enforce rules. 
   - Simultaneous & spontaneous participation. Build on others ideas.
   - At the end of the session, vote on favorite ideas.
   - Group size of up to 12 are effective.
2. Nominal idea generation sessions - done individually, so participants are not influenced by social factors.
   - Cannot build on others ideas because not exposed to them, but they won't be afraid of criticism.
   - Highly motivated for individual rewards.
   - Helps bolster quantity + quality of ideas.
3. Computer Mediated Ideation - electronic brainstorming in which users are asked to generate creative responses to a question or prompt. **NOT FORUMS** OR **BLOGS**.

Can combine these methods to be more effective. 

Electronic is good for helping allow asynchronous brainstorming.
