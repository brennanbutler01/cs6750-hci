# Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: New Ideation Strategies for Distributed HCI Design

**Cheatstorming** - Previously generated brainstorm ideas are delivered to targeted local contexts without the need for
imaginative ideation.

**Ideation** - Radical redistribution of ideas to unconventionalize a given context.

Brainstorming has less to do with the creation of novel ideas, and more to do with its cultural influence on the
ideating team.

## Brainstorming

Obsborn's three phases of brainstorming:

1. Fact-Finding - Problem-definition and preparation.
2. Idea-Finding - Idea-production and idea-development. Select and combine tentative ideas.
3. Solution-Finding - Evaluation and adoption. Verifying offered solution and implementing a final set.

Brainstorming might be less effective than individual idea generation.

Obsorn's guidelines and rules were intended to make brainstorming more effective for groups, and includes principles
like going wild with ideas and avoiding judging ideas.

Brainstorming might just be a supplement to individual ideation and not a replacement.

### Brainstorming Limitations

1. Production Blocking - only one person speaks at a time. Ideas are suppressed or forgotten later. Listening to others'
   ideas might distract thought process and ability to record their own ideas.
2. Evaluation Apprehension - fear of being criticized might lead people to participate less.
3. free riding - motivation to work decreases because of the lack of feedback and recognition.

### Structuring Ideation

Context is required because just simply looking at brainstorming empirically is not enough. It is important for team
building and takes into consideration rules, culture, problem space, etc.

Can use oblique strategies, random input, etc. to generate novel ideas.

#### Social Configurations of Idea Generation Behavior

1. Face-to-face brainstorming - 15 to 45-minute sessions led by brainstorming expert to enforce rules.
    - Simultaneous & spontaneous participation. Build on others ideas.
    - At the end of the session, vote on favorite ideas.
    - Group size of up to 12 are effective.
2. Nominal idea generation sessions - done individually, so participants are not influenced by social factors.
    - Cannot build on others ideas because not exposed to them, but they won't be afraid of criticism.
    - Highly motivated for individual rewards.
    - Helps bolster quantity + quality of ideas.
3. Computer Mediated Ideation - electronic brainstorming in which users are asked to generate creative responses to a
   question or prompt. **NOT FORUMS** OR **BLOGS**.

Can combine these methods to be more effective.

Electronic is good for helping allow asynchronous brainstorming.

### Opportunity finding

When you have a topic for which to design, can:

1. Sketch designs and goals
2. Analyze aspects of design and make observations - note them.
3. Create a matrix and and rank them.

Benefits of this process:

1. Reveals hidden / personal meanings
2. Facilitates discovery of thinking patterns
3. Tracks creative influence and motivates participation
4. Associate and juxtapose unexpected ideas
5. Help people find the ideas that are important to them
6. Invent and embody create movements
7. Spark interest and freedom.

### Ideation Techniques

1. Ideation: The generation and elaboration of ideas.
2. Brainstorming: The generation and elaboration of language-based ideas.
3. Electronic Brainstorming: The generation and elaboration of ideas mediated by computers.
4. Chainstorming: The generation and elaboration of ideas by passing them along communication chains.
5. Cheatstorming: Brainstorming without the generation component - quick creative judgement tasks where you vote.
6. Tweetstorming: A digital chainstorming application that leverages cheatstorming to study it.

### Cheatstorming

Participants vote on favorite ideas and those are selected. Then another topic, and another set of voting.

__No new ideas are necessary for further ideation to occur__.

Bypass concept generation and goes directly to voting on ideas.

Fast, fun, low effort means of creative ideation. Give different diverse inputs.
Leads to a __technology brokering__ among brainstorming team s where ideas cross pollinate.

It worked better when the ideas came from the same source and were not color-coded.

After successive rounds, the same answers kept popping up. The ideas became less interesting and harder to associate
with new outcomes, so not repeating ideas.

### Stages of Chainstorming and Tweetstorming

1. Prompting - Facilitator presents challenge to the group to drive ideation
2. Sharing - participants suggest and communicate ideas
3. Selecting - participants vote on ideas
4. Committing - the ideas that will be moved forward are evaluated and prioritized

Ideas are transferred rather than generated. Generation results from interplay between participants conception of an
idea and misinterpretation of another.

**Cheatstorming** is ideation without idea generation and **chainstorming** is a paradigm of communicative ideation.

Chainstorming is social, like the broken telephone game, and it depends on a good foundation for being conducted
effectively. Tweetstorming is going to use an online platform to distribute chainstorming.
