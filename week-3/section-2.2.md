# 2.2 Feedback Cycles

Ubiquitous, they are everywhere. Feedback cycles are how we learn everything. Do something, see
result, and then adjust what we do accordingly.

do something, learn from the experience - adaptive behavior. getting better over time!

all of hci is an application of feedback cycles - person and task, person and interface, systems of
multiple people and interfaces.

## Gulf of Execution

How do I know what I can do? How to figure out what actions to take to make the state of the system
match their goal state? How hard is it to do in the interface?

1. Identity intentions - what is the goal in the context of the system?
2. Identify actions to accomplish goals.
3. Execute the actions within the interface.

To bridge, maybe the interface should help us re-frame our questions.

5 tips:

1. Make functions discoverable. It should be clear what a user can do.
2. Let the user mess around - let them feel safe, avoid buttons that cause harm.
3. Be consistent with other tools - use standards that other tools use.
4. Know your user - for novices, identifying intentions and actions is most important. for experts,
   actually doing the action is more valuable, care about efficiency.
5. feedforward - feedback on what the user might want to do. help them predict what will happen as a
   result of their action.

## Gulf  of Evaluation

Express through the interface the result of the actions that the user took.

1. Physical form of output - visual, sound, some kind of output.
2. Interpretation of the output for the real meaning of the feedback.
3. Evaluation of the interpretation to figure out if goals were accomplished.

5 tips:

1. give constant feedback - do not wait for feedback. show them right away. help them understand
   where the system is in executing.
2. give feedback immediately - even if it is not a full response. let the user know their input is
   recognized.
3. match feedback to the action. subtle actions should have subtle feedback.
4. vary feedback. sometimes can do it on the screen, other times can do sounds or haptic feedback.
5. leverage direct manipulation - let the user feel that they are directly manipulating.

## Norman's Bridge

Norman proposes considering Gulfs as bridges because this is how the gulf is bridged.

1. Bridge of Execution - make the world match goal
    - Plan
    - Specify
    - Perform
2. Bridge of Evaluation - check that the system state matches the goal
    - Perceive
    - Interpret
    - Compare

7 Questions:

1. How easily can one determine the function of the device? (goal) What do I want to do?
2. How easily can one determine what actions are possible? (planning) What are the alternatives?
3. How easily can one determine the mapping from intent to movement? (specify) What can I do to
   actually perform?
4. How easily can one actually perform the physical actions? (perform) How do I do that?
5. How easily can the user tell what state the system is in? (perceive) What happened?
6. How easily can they tell if the system is in the desired state? (interpret) What does that mean?
7. How easily can the user determine the mapping from state to interpretation? (compare) Is that
   okay?

Phases:

1. Visceral - Perform and perceiving - Reaction
2. Behavioral - Specifying and interpreting - Deliberation
3. Reflective - plan and compare - Metacognition
