# Norman - Cognitive Engineering CH 3

**Cognitive Engineering** attempts to apply cognitive science to computers. Understand principles
behind human action relevant for engineering design, and to devise systems that are pleasant to use.
_Pleasurable Engagement_ is the goal.

To make tasks successful, we want to make sure we have the correct conceptual

## Psychological/Physical Variables Variables

Good design, that is pleasing, requires us to make sure we are providing control over variables of
psychological interest!

## Aspects of a task

1. Matching psychological variables of interest to the physical variables that are being controlled.
2. Mapping relationships between physical mechanisms and system state - interaction between two
   controls should be easy - we should be able to map b/w control and function, control and outcome
3. Feedback - feedback should be immediate, not slow
4. Conceptual Model - need a solid and robust, clear, conceptual model.
5. Goals, intentions - goal is the state that the person wants to achieve and the intention is the
   decision to act to achieve that goal.
6. specifications of the action sequence - the psychological process of determining the
   psychological representation of the actions that are to be executed by the user.
7. Physical state of system - determined by the values of all physical variables.
8. Control mechanisms - physical devices that control physical variables.
9. Interpretation of system state
10. Evaluating the outcome.

## Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation

Issues arise because of the difficulty translating the psychological desires and needs of the user
into the physical tasks they will take using the controls to get to their desired system state. user
creates plans, action sequences, and interpretations that move the description of goals and
intentions closer to that required by the physical system.

### Bridging gap of Execution:

1. Intention - start thinking about making an action -
2. Determine an action sequence - match internal specification to the external. Translate
   psychological goals of intention into the changes that need made to the physical variables under
   control of the system and follow the mapping between psychological intentions and physical
   actions permitted on the system, as well as the mapping between physical mechanisms and the
   resulting physical state variables, and psychological goals/intentions to physical state of the
   system.
3. Executing Action - first physical action in sequence - do the stuff!
4. Making contact with input mechanisms of the interface and doing the stuff you want.

### Bridging Gulf of Evaluation

Evaluation requires comparing the interpretation of system state with original goals/intentions.
Determine what the state is.
Use:

1. the displays of interface
2. perceptual processing of displays
3. interpret displays
4. evaluate and compare the system state with goals/intentions.

### Stages of user activities

1. Establish Goal
2. Form Intention
3. Specify Action Sequence
4. Execute Action
5. Perceiving System State
6. Interpret System State
7. Evaluate System State with respect to Goals and Intentions.

### Implications of Gulf b/w Execution - Evaluation.

Because of gulfs, we need to try to move the system closer to the user or user closer to the system.

To do so, we want to try to make things easier to understand, provide visual clues, or language
clues to let people know. System designer should help to understand the system. need coherent design
model and system image.

## Conceptual Models and System Image

Conceptual model provides scaffolding's to build bridges across gaps in execution and evaluation.
Essential for learning and troubleshooting. Allow user to derive possible courses of actions and
responses. Needs to be designed and consistent - so that the user can develop a mental model of the
system.

1. Design Model - Conceptual model held by designer
    - model of system to be built-based on user task, requirements, capabilities.
    - needs to consider user background, experience, limits
2. User Model - conceptual model held by the user
    - user mental model that results from user interpretation of system image.
    - designer should want the user's model to be compatible with the design model.
    - Through interaction with the system image, the design model and user model can be in sync.
3. System Image - image resulting from physical structure that has been built
    - the more consistent, well-designed it is, the smaller the gap b/w design and user model.
    - easier to make a good one for specific, complicated tasks (like addition, subtraction)

## Quality of HCI

Pleasurable programs should be the goal... should be fun to use.

systems need to provide strong sense of understanding and control. they should reveal their
underlying conceptual model, emphasize comfort, ease, and pleasure. _convivial fools_.

Computer should be invisible to the user and not intrude upon user.

## Power of Tools

Systems should be viewed as tools, when they are good!

- smalltalk
- xerox star
- unix
  -spreadsheets
  -steamer - steam generator system for large ships that uses intelligent graphics to help

need a balance between super intelligent and super simple tools! _conviviality_, make visible
operations and assumptions of tools. Make sure we also give the user a good image of what is going
on.

## Gulfs Revisited

Most of the pleasurableness from a good system results from the direct relationship b/w
psychological and physical variables - a good bridging.

- need:
    - clear mapping from psychological variables in which goals are stated to physical variables
      upon which controls are exerted
    - mapping of physical variables of the system to psychological variables.

more direct mapping = better systems.

**Levels?** How much is the proper level.

## Design Issue

Design is so hard because of number of variables/potential actions is huge, and the tech is limited.

We want to create **USER-CENTERED INTERFACE**.

APPROXIMATE models are okay (Short term memory used as example)

## Tradeoffs

We are always going to have to make compromises and tradeoffs in our design. look at design as a
whole, not isolated people!

Info vs Time: more info available slows down the system, increases time to do tasks.

To make good designs, make sure that you focus on the user model, design model, and the system
image. These are **FIRST ORDER ISSUES** .

VisiCalc is one of the best examples... commands were a second order issue - the design was primary!
helped by the fact it was **self-contained* and the user was a frequent user!

## Prescriptions

1. Create a science of user centered design - we want principles that can be applied at the time of
   the design. get design to a pretty good state the first time around. need principles and tools

2. take interface design seriously - need knowledge of design/programming/tech, knowledge of the
   people/psych/communication, and knowledge of the task that is going to be accomplished.

3. separate the design of the interface from design of system - modularize. they should be
   separated.

4. DO UCD! start with user needs
