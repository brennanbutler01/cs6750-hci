## Time Scale of Human Action

Newell's 4 band - each with 3 levels within:

1. Biological Band
2. Cognitive Band - research on selection techniques, menu design, feedback, text entry. time from 200ms - 24s
3. Rational Band - tasks span minutes or hours. web navigation, user search, ucd, collaborative computing, etc.
4. Social Band - days/weeks/months. workplace habits, groupware usage, social networking, online dating, user style and
   preferences.
5. Historical band - years - thousands of years.
6. Evolutionary band - 10000s to millions of years.

Most common dependent variable in experimental research is time, time it takes to do a task.

HCI Research is high level and low level. At the low level, it is quantitative.At the high level (social), it is
qualitative. At the social level, researchers use interviews, observation, case studies, etc.

## Human Factors

Processor model (i/o) vs human factor model (human as a machine).

In human factor model, human monitors state of computer through sensors and displays and controls the state of computer
through responders and controls.

## Sensors

The 5 human senses.

### Vision (Sight)

80% of info comes through vision for most people.

Properties:

1. Frequency - leads to the perception of color.
2. Intensity - luminance of light, brightness
3. Fixations and saccades - during fixations, eyes are stationary. Saccades are really quick.

In HCI, check the scanpath or sequence of eye movements that occurs when users view a UI.

### Hearing (Audition)

Properties:

1. Loudness - # of DB - sound pressure level
2. Pitch - frequency
3. Timbre - richness or brightness
4. Envelope - way notes and harmonics build and transition over time from silent -> audible -> silent

### Touch (Tactition)

Part of the somatosensory system - sensory receptors for touch, temperature, pain and position.

### Smell (olfaction) and Taste (gustation)

Not used too often in HCI...

### Other Senses

Senses of urgency, common sense, musical, and moral sense play roles in HCI.

## Responders

Movement by humans ton control the world around them.

### Limbs Movement

Movement of limbs is coupled with somatosensory system - proprioception as the coordination of limb movement and
position.

### Voice

Through speaking, move voice by moving vocal chords.

NVVI - Non Verbal Voice Interaction

### Eyes

Eye as both responder and sensor. Use __soft controls__ to control virtual or graphical controls that appear on the
system's display. Need some eye tracking.

Can use eye typing to select keys on an on-screen keyboard using eyes.

## Brain
Most complex biological structure in the brain. Connects sensors (inputs) and responders (outputs).

### Perception
First stage of processing. Receive signals from as input from environment.

Associations nad meanings happen here.

Perception studied in psycho-physics - examining relationship between human perception and physical phenomena.

Measure the just noticeable difference (JND) in stimulus and see how it is perceived different.

Perception and ambiguity - human ability to develop multiple interpretations of the same sensory input. 

Illusions of visual and other stimuli.  Phantom limbs after amputation.

### Cognition
Human process of conscious thinking.  Hard to study since it is inside of the brain.

### Memory
Information storage, retainment, recall. 

Long term memory - experiences from days or decades ago. 

Memory, like a computer, is split into a declarative/explicit information about events in time/objects in external world, and an implicit/procedural area that stores information about how to use objects and do things.

Within the long-term memory, there is an area for short-term memory and working-memory. 

Working-memory: immediately available for access, but is small (only about 7 units).

## Language
Language is available to most humans. Speech without effort. Writing is more recent.

Study language through corpus of text created.

### Redundancy in Language
reduce redundancy for better understanding, but humans are good at filling in the gaps in native language. We use what we inherently know.

### Entropy in Language
Entropy is uncertainty about forthcoming letters, words, phrases, ideas.

## Human Performance 
Human Performance happens when sensors, brain, responders all work together to achieve a goal. Have to consider the speed-accuracy trade-off. As we do things faster, we lose accuracy. Doing things slower increases accuracy.

### Reaction Time

Human performance is manifested in simple reaction time - the delay between the occurrence of a stimulus and the initiation of a response.

Do physical matching, name matching (change appearance), class matching (both letters or both digits) and choice reaction (n stimuli - 1:1 correspondence between stimuli and response)

### Visual Search
Visual search - scan collection if items to find the one that is desired.

### Attention
Human ability to remember and to attend is limited. Attention is the human property that occurs when a person who is attending to one thing cannot attend to another. 

Two themes:
1. Divided Attention - process of concentration on and doing more than one task a time.
2. Selected attention - focused. Doing one task and excluding others.


### Human Error
Does the environment impact?

Are the errors due to human error or design induced?
