# Section 2.3 - Direct Manipulation

## Good Interfaces

**Direct Manipulation** - Users should feel like they are directly controlling the object of their task.

**Invisible Interfaces** - Interfaces should be so natural that they almost disappear. The user does not have to think
about the interface at all.

Our goal is to make manipulation of an interface as direct and invisible as possible.

## Distance

Distance exists between user and the interface, so we want to make sure things are as close as possible - limit the
distance.
More cognitive load, more distance and more effort required.

Two types of distances (gulfs of executions/evaluation):

1. Semantic distance - distance b/w user's goals and expressions - how hard it is to know what to do
    - identify intentions
    - identify actions
2. Articulatory distance - distance between expression and execution - how hard it is to actually do what we know we
   need to do .
    - execute actions

We can bridge these distances when we immediately understand the form and meaning of inputs and outputs to the system.

We feel like we are directly control of the objects, without the program even existing.

VR systems might help to make direct manipulation and invisible interfaces more possible, but we need better feedback.

When designing interfaces, places that are not direct can feel more direct through the use of careful animations and
intelligent design.

## Invisible Interfaces
Interface becomes invisible - this is our ultimate goal! Users shouldn't spend any time thinking about - able to act directly with the task itself.

Interfaces can become invisible just through use - it does not mean that they are great designs.

## Invisible By Design
Invisible from the very first use - even without learning!

Tips:
1. Use affordances - places where visual design of interface suggest how it is meant to be used.
2. Know your user - know for whom you are trying to design
3. Differentiate your user - multiple ways to complete the same task.
4. Let interface teach - interface should teach users.
5. Talk to your user - ask them what they are thinking.
