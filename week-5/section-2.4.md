# 2.4 Human Abilities

Psychology of humans and what they can do:

- input - how stimuli are sensed by the world and perceived by the mind
- processing - how the brain processes and reasons to stimuli received
- output -how the brain controls the person's actions in the real world

Use the human as a **processor** - i/o.

## Visual Perception

Most important things should be in the middle.

We should not use too much color coding.

## Auditory Perception

Hard to hear most things.

## Haptic Perception

Skin can feel some things. Pressure, vibration, temperature.

Touch needs to be designed more explicitly now as a result of VR.

## Memory

At least 3 kinds:

1. Perceptual Store
    - lasts less than a second, working memory. more expertise, longer lasting
    - 3 parts: all 3 are coordinated by a central executive
        1. Visuospatial sketchpad - visual info for active manipulation.
        2. Phonological loop - sounds/speech for active manipulation.
        3. Episodic buffer - integrates info from other systems and
2. Short-Term Memory - four to five chunks at a time can be stored.
    - Chunking: Grouping together several bits of info into one chunk. Make data easier to chunk for users.
    - Leverage recognition, rather than recall. it is more effective.
3. Long-Term Memory - unlimited store of memories.
    - needs to be stored into short-term memory multiple times to page into long-term memory.

## Learning

Two types of learning:

1. Procedural - How to do something. something you **do**. generally what we are doing in HCI.
2. Declarative - knowledge **about** something.

Unconsciously competent - so good at something that it makes it hard to explain to someone else and communicate in
declarative knowledge.

## Cognitive Load
Brain has certain # of resources - used up by things on which you are working.

Goals:
1. Reduce cognitive load posed by interface
2. Understand context of what else is competing for cognitive resources.

To reduce:
1. Use multiple modalities - verbal + visual + haptic
2. let modalities complement one another - don't give two separate contents. use each modality to help explain the others.
3. give the user the control of the pace - allow the user to control how long something is going to take to complete.
4. emphasize essential content - minimize unnecessary content. design interface to emphasize the most common actions
5. offload tasks - ask to see if part of the task can be offloaded through the interface.
