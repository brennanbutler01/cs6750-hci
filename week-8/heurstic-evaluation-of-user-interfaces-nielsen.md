# Heuristic Evaluation of User Interfaces

Heuristic evaluation is an informal method of usability analysis where evaluators are asked to comment on a present UI. Should be done in aggregate.

## Four ways to evaluate user interfaces

1. Formally - some analysis technique
2. Automatically - using computerized procedure
3. Empirically - experiments 
4. Heuristically - looking at the interface and passing judgement accorindg to opinion.

Because empirical evaluation takes so much time, we use heuristic evaluations.

## Heuristic Evaluation of User Interfaces

Look at the UI and come up with an opinion according to 9 basic usability principles.

1. Simple an natural dailogue
2. Speak the user's lanugage
3. Minimiez user memory laod
4. Be consistent
5. Provide feedback
6. Provide clearly marked exists
7. Provides hortcuts
8. Good error messages
9. Prevent errors


### Conclusions

Heuristic evaluation is:
1. Cheap
2. Intuitive, easy to motivate participants
3. Does not require advanced planning
4. Can be used early

Disadvantages:
1. Identifiers problems without ideas for solutions
