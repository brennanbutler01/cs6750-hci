# Cognitive Walkthrough - method for theory-based evaluation

Cognitive walkthrough aims to provide a new tool for usability early in the design process. Allows designers to anticipate some learnability problems prior to implementation.Author presents his proposed design to a group of peers who evaluate using an explicit set of criteria. Evaluate the ease with which users cna perform a task with little or no formal instruction.


Step through actions uf ser , consider behavior of the interface, and user's thoughts witha ttention to those tasks that might be difficult.

## Application of cognitive theory

Focus on ease of learning. 

## Theory of learning by exploration

Users of a system must guess what to do.

Basis on Kintsch's construction integration model - users integrate a representation of text or other input to construct a representation to perform a task. An initial goal structure is constructed from a description, these are then represented by propositons, linked to other goals, backgorund knowledg,e environment, actions. Responses by the system are observed and interpreted. These results in new goals, changes in environment. these are linked to other porpositions and new actions occur.

### Link between Goals and Actions
