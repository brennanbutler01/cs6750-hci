## 1.2 Intro to CS6750
Three Learning Goals:
1. Understand the principles of HCI.
2. Understand the design life cycle (with iteration).
3. Understand current applications of HCI.

Learning outcome:
1. Be able to design effective interactions between humans and computers. Apply known principles to new problems. Work to gather information, refine interace based on user feedback. Principles + Methods of HCI.

How to measure usability?
1. Is effectiveness or research the goal? Or is it to change an activity? Effectiveness will be determined by what our goal is.

### Important points
1. We design interactions, not interfaces.
2. When designing interactions, you are not the user!
