# Human Centered Design Considered Harmful

Paradox of understanding users—if you need to design for everyone, can we design for anyone?

Everyday objects become familiar over time, as does driving. We actually adapt to the tool, not the tool to us.

**Activity Centered Design** - interfaces like the automobile are not human centered, but they are invisible and
pleasurable because they invoke principles of Activity Centered Design. In Activity-centered design, designers require a
deep understanding of the activities that are going to be performed using the interface.

## Activities vs. Tasks

From the highest level to lowest:

1. Activities—highest level—made of several tasks

2. Tasks—made of several actions

3. Actions—made of several operations

4. Operations

An activity is a coordinated, integrated set of tasks.

## Who adapts? Tech or people?

Despite human-centered design stressing the need for interfaces to adapt to the user, it is really the user that adapts
to interfaces like driving, the watch, music instruments, writing systems, and other adopted tools.

## Human Centered vs. Activity Centered

These non-human-centered designs are so successful because:

1. Activity centered design - the designers clearly understood the activity

2. Clear communication of intention from the builders and designers

Attitude is the main difference between human-centered and activity-centered design.

ACD combines a deep understanding of human constraints, user experience with a deep understanding of the technology,
tools, and the reasons for the activities in question.

## Tools define the activity

In ACD, we admit that humans must adapt to the tools, not the other way around. We must learn and adopt mores, customs,
conventions.

Adapting to technology changes society and family structure, and ACD wants to exploit this fact.

Learn the activity and the tools will be understood. Learn the tools and the activity will be understood.

With HCD, the tool should become invisible. With ACD, the tool is everything!

## Why is HCD harmful?

Focus on individual groups or people may provide advantages for one person at the expense of another, harming equity.

The individual is a moving and evolving target.

The focus on humans detracts support from the activity themselves.

Too much attention to the needs of users leads to lack of cohesion and added design complexity.

## Static screens vs dynamic sequences

HCD is static and doesn't consider sequences.

ACD focuses on the sequence of tasks.

## Too much listening to users

HCD teaches us to always listen to users, but we can listen to them too much and cause complex designs.

ACD focuses on the activity, not the human, so there is a cohesive, well-articulated design model.

Sometimes we need to ignore user requests and dictate design. Listening to users creates fragments.
