# Design Principles

Four main sets of design principles:

1. Don Norman's Six design principles
2. Nielsen comes up with ten principles
3. Larry Constantine and Lucy Lockwood came with six principles
4. Ronald Mace proposed seven principles of Universal Design - Universal Design stresses designing for EVERY
   user—regardless of skill, age, background, language, etc.

## Discoverability

Figuring out which actions are possible, where to perform them?

Users should be able to figure out what to do easily! It should be easy, fast, quick to find relevant functions through
using the interface/application.

Walk a line between discoverability and simplicity.

## Simplicity

Simplicity is in tension with discoverability. Harder to find things when there is more on the screen! Need a balance.

## Affordances

Affordances—the design hints on how to use the interface/application. Helps keep things discoverable, but simple.

An affordance for one person is not necessarily an affordance for everyone. It is different for each user!

Can use signifiers, in-context instructions or other visual hints that help intuitively map controls to affordances.

### Affordance Vocabulary

Affordances to Norman are inherent to the device.

A perceived affordance is a property attributed to an object or user by a human. Can be inaccurate. It Can be
in-conflict
with the real, actual affordance.

Signifiers help the perceived affordance match the actual affordance. Helps to correct potential misunderstandings from
taking place or mitigate the negative impact of that.

We cannot add affordance to the interface—but we **CAN ADD SIGNIFIERS** to the interface.

## Mapping

Mapping between interfaces and the world! We Should connect to the user in their own terms and follow real-world
conventions.

Strong mappings help make information appear more natural. They help create an understanding between an action and the
effect that the action will have.

## Perceptibility

User's ability to perceive the state of the system within a reasonable time.

Everyone should be able to perceive the current state!

## Consistency

Being consistent across what we create. Consistency is virtuous.

Designs should re-use and maintain consistency with purpose.

Create expectations about affordances offered and then fulfill them consistently.

## Flexibility

Differentiate features based on the skills of the user.

Accelerators help allow users to tailor their actions.

## Equity

The design should be useful and marketable to users with diverse abilities. Avoid stigmatizing users, allow all users to
use things the same way or an equivalent means when not possible.

Every user should have the same benefits, experience, rights, security.

## Ease and Comfort

Ease—Design can be used efficiently and comfortably with minimum fatigue.

Comfort—the appropriate size and space is provided for manipulation, use, regardless of user's body size, posture,
mobility.

## Structure

Overall architecture of user interface: design should organize the UI purposefully and be clear and consistent.

Grouping, differentiation, and organization of the UI are critical. Help the user's mental model match the content of
the task.

## Constraints

Accounting for user error. Avoid error by constraining the user to only performing the correct action in the first
place.

Limit the possible actions to allow users to determine the correct course of action, even in a novel situation.

Stop faulty user input before it is received.

## Norman's Four Constraints

How to ensure correct input:

1. Physical constraints (physical limitations)—like 3 prong plugs.
2. Cultural constraints—rules that dictate cultural norms. like escalators
3. Semantic constraint—inherent to the meaning of the situation. like rearview mirrors must reflect backwards.
4. Logical constraint—self-evident constraints based on the situation. like screws - if just one left, it must go in the
   empty hole.

## Tolerance

Users shouldn't be at risk of causing too much trouble accidentally. Need clearly marked emergency exits. Undo/redo
should be supported. Prevent errors whenever possible.

## Feedback

Feedback should be immediate and informative. Bad feedback is worse than none at all.

## Documentation

A great interface helps make it so that users do not need documentation! We should still provide an easy-to-search,
manageable source of documentation.
