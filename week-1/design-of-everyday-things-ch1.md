# Design of Everyday Things Chapter 1

1. Two most important characteristics of good design:
    1. Discoverability - is it possible to figure out what actions are possible
    2. Understanding - what does it mean?
2. Interaction Design - how people interact with technology. enhance understanding of what can be
   done, what is happening, and what has occurred.
3. Experience Design - designing products, processes, services with a focus on the quality and
   enjoyment of the total experience.
4. Need Human-centered design, put human needs, capabilities, and behavior first. Need good
   communication. Ensure that designs match the needs and capabilities of the people who will use
   it.
    * Avoid specifying the problem as long as possible - iterate upon repeated approximations.
5. Affordances - relationship b/w physical object and a person (is for something). not a property
   but a relationship - needs object + agent. affordances should be discoverable - perceivable, but
   can be invisible. determines what actions are possible
6. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. communicates the purpose, structure,
   operation of device.
7. Mapping - the relationship between two sets of things. should be a mapping between a control,
   action, and the intended result. grouping and proximity, should be natural. these can be
   culturally specific. works best when set of actions is visible and controls exploit natural
   mapping. need care, planning, thought, and an understanding of how people behave.
8. Feedback - need a way to let you know if the system is working on the request. should be
   immediate and informative - but not too much. feedback should be planned.
9. Conceptual model - explanation of how something looks. mental models of how things work. can be
   competing
10. System Image - the combined total of information available to us about a product, system. needs
    to be more complete, coherent.
11. Paradox of tech - as we get more features packed into a device that make it more useful, it gets
    harder to learn and use.
