1. The classroom is now a user interface itself. Learning design and user interface design both
   require rapid feedback.
2. Flexibility - design should accommodate a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.
   actions should be tailored.
    1. Geographic flexibility - students can study from anywhere. ties into equity.
    2. Temporal flexibility - can take classes when you want.
    3. Preference flexibility - can watch on your own time, skip things if needed.
3. Equity - should be accessible, no stigmatization.
    1. financial - not expensive
    2. admissions - no limit on enrollment.
    3. anonymity - can choose what you want to reveal.
4. Consistency - users shouldn't have to wonder whether words, actions, situations mean the same
   thing. should follow conventions
    1. assignment cadence - everything always available. weekly deliverables
    2. announcement - weekly lectures w/ expectations.

       always pull information from online materials.
