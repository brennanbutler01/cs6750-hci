# 1.2 Intro to CS6750

Three Learning Goals:

1. Understand the principles of HCI.
2. Understand the design life cycle (with iteration).
3. Understand current applications of HCI.

Learning outcome:

1. Be able to design effective interactions between humans and computers. Apply known principles to
   new problems. Work to gather information, refine interface based on user feedback. Principles +
   Methods of HCI.

How to measure usability?

1. Is effectiveness or research the goal? Or is it to change an activity? Effectiveness will be
   determined by what our goal is.

## Important points

1. We design interactions, not interfaces.
2. When designing interactions, you are not the user!
