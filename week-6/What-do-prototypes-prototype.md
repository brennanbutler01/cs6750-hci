# What do prototypes prototype?

Treat prototypes as an artifact—explore the role that they play, look and feel, implementation. Focus on the purpose
of the prototype!

## Problem with Prototypes

Discuss prototypes with three audiences:

1. Intended users
2. Design teams
3. Supporting organizations

Prototypes are hard to build. Limited understanding of design practices, prototypes are not self-explanatory, many
audiences to have to navigate

## Prototypes use over form

The form of the typical prototype within each organization should not limit the possibilities of what can be considered
a valid and useful prototype. Think about the use instead.

## Problems with Current Terminology

Too much focus paid to the tools used or the level of fidelity.

**Resolution** is the amount of detail

**Fidelity** is the closeness to the eventual design

## Model

Artifact - interactive system that is being designed

Prototype—representation of a design idea

### 3 dimensions of a model:

1. Role - questions about the function of artifact in user's life
2. Look and feel—how the system looks and how the user feels when using
3. Implementation—techniques and components that make the artifact work.

#### Role Prototypes

Investigate questions of what an artifact could do for a user. Describe functionality that a user could benefit from.

#### Look and Feel Prototypes

Demonstrate and explore options for the concrete experience of an artifact.

#### Implementation Prototypes

Prototypes built to answer technical questions about how a future artifact might actually work.

#### Integration Prototypes

Prototypes built to represent the complete user experience of an artifact. Brings together a role, look and feel, and
implementation.

## Lessons

1. Define prototype broadly—don't take a narrow view of what should be explored.
2. Build multiple prototypes, multiple types
3. Know the audience
4. Know the prototype and prepare the audience
