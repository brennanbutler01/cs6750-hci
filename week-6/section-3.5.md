# Section 3.5 - Prototyping

Involves looking at different ideas available and developing them. We are going to build something to actually put
in-front of users. Get user feedback as quickly and rapidly as possible. Iterate.

Start with **low-fidelity** and then iterate to **high-fidelity**, wireframes, working versions.

## Basics of Prototyping

**Representation** - What is the prototype? How easy are they to build over time?
**Fidelity** - Completeness or maturity of the prototype.
**Scope** - Horizontal vs vertical.

- Horizontal - cover design as a whole in a shallow way
- Vertical - take small portion of interaction and prototype in great detail.

Early Prototyping:

- Rapid iteration.
- Verbal **representation** or just sketched out on a piece of paper.
- **Low Fidelity** - Fine for evaluating function of interface (can it do what it should...). Wireframes allow us to
  check readability.
- Start with horizontal

Late Prototyping:

- Finalizing designs.
- Functional, physical **representation**. Only build these after we are pretty sure we know what we
  want.
- **Higher Fidelity** - allows us to determine efficiencies, fine-tuning. evaluate performance
- move to vertical as we dial in

## Trade-Offs

Lo-Fi vs Hi-Fi involves tradeoffs. We want to maximize:

- start with lo-fi to get started, make sure we are on the right track
- after having initial evidence our designs are sound, we will work towards higher fidelity.

**deliberate design** with __frequent feedback__

## 5 Tips for prototyping:

1. Keep prototypes easy to change
2. Make it clear that it is a prototype. Don't make it too good.
3. Be creative
4. Evaluate Risks
5. Prototype for feedback - try to get feedback!

## Verbal Prototypes
**Revisable during interaction** and **disguises superficial details**.

Describe the design we have in mind to user.

Lowest fidelity possible.

Social desirability bias - participants won't feel comfy disagreeing. Ask for feedback specifically. Check for expert
blind spot to make sure that the user really understands... describe in analogy and metaphors, make it relatable to
another interface.

## Paper Prototypes
**Revisable during interaction** and **disguises superficial details**.
Draw them out! Tells the user that we are focused more on structure, less on specifics. Easy to change!

Can do some interactions also. Do some walk through on paper.

### Card Prototypes
**Revisable during interaction** and **disguises superficial details** and **simulates user interaction**.
Like paper but -
Put each screen on a card, **card prototyping** to prototype interactions with low effort.

## Wizard of Oz/
**Revisable during interaction** and **disguises superficial details** and **simulates user interaction** and **allows mobility during evaluation**.

For voice or gestures, use **wizard of oz** prototyping. We are behind the curtain, doing the things that the interface
will actually do when implemented.

Tell the user how things would work, that we will simulate the interactions.

Ask for feedback and check to evaluate.

User can interact authentically with the system.

## Wireframing
**Simulates user interaction** and **easily distributable to remote users** and **supports prototyping look and feel**.
Formalize designs a bit more into a wireframe. Use detailed tools to show how the design will look.

Add in font size, colors, screen real-estate. Can do in ppt or google docs. Can do axure, balsamiq, figma, visio,
inDesign, etc.

Free tools: pencil project & framebox.

## Physical Prototypes
**Simulates user interaction** and **supports prototyping look and feel** and **allows mobility during evaluation**.
Might need to make something **physical** - doesn't have to work 100%. Can test without implementing everything or
ANYTHING.
