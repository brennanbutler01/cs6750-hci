# The Aware Home

Experiment set inside a real home that they will live in.

## Research Agenda

### Context Awareness and Ubiquitous Sensing

Computers aren't great in context, but we want to bolster ubiquitous sensing capabilities. We also need rapid
development models that can build software quickly and respond to context.

### Individual Interactions within the home

Users should be able to place limits on the type and level of information that they transfer to the personal
environment.

### Smart Floor

Footsteps will locate the people. Using HRRM, we can identify the correct user by how they step.

### FLO - Finding lost objects

The hope is that the house will track lost objects.

## Human-Centered Agenda

### Elderly Support

Old people move to assisted living for security, this study hopes to provide monitoring that allows people to stay in
their home.

3 goals:

1. Support social connections between parents and children
2. support everyday cognition by replacing memory
3. sense and identify crisis that may occur
