# Distributed Cognition

InfoVis the use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of abstract data to amplify cognition.

The paper argues to use the distributed cognition framework as a theoretical framework for InfoVis.

It may be necessary to make cognition a research agenda for InfoVis researchers.

## Distributed Cognition: An environmental perspective

### Traditional Cognition

Artifacts like visual tools amplify cognition and serve as scaffolds for cognition.

traditional studies treat cognition as information processing inside the brain and
focus on how symbols are stored and processed inside
the brain, but this ignores the larger environment.

### Distributed Cognition

Tools do not amplify cognition. Tools allow us to do challenging tasks more easily, without having to know about what is
going on behind the scenes always.

For distributed cognition, we should not say that tools amplify cognition, because it blurs the line between the cognitive properties of systems composed of individuals manipulating tools and the cognitive properties of individual minds, which can cause to overascribing problems to an individual.

We should look at the artifacts as cultural and the individual as a member of a larger group of individuals.

Individuals and their environment make intelligence.

Environmental perspectives emphasize cognition as embodied, enculturated, situated in local interactions, and distributed across cultural artifacts.

Cognitive and cultural processes are intertwined. Cognition is an emergent property of interactions

Unit of analysis should be a cognitive system composed of individuals and cultrual artifacts, not one person.

The propogation of representation states is acocmplished by human and artifact components.

Interdependency between people and the artifacts they use.
