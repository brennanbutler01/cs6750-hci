# Distributed Cognition

InfoVis means using computer-supported, interactive,
visual representations of abstract data to amplify cognition.

The paper argues to use the distributed cognition framework as a theoretical framework for InfoVis.

It may be necessary to make cognition a research agenda for InfoVis researchers.

## Distributed Cognition: An environmental perspective

### Traditional Cognition

Artifacts like visual tools amplify cognition and serve as scaffolds for cognition.

traditional studies treat cognition as information processing inside the brain and
focus on how symbols are stored and processed inside
the brain, but this ignores the larger environment.

### Distributed Cognition

Tools do not amplify cognition.
Tools allow us to do challenging tasks more easily, without having
to know about what is
going on behind the scenes always.

For distributed cognition, we should not say that tools amplify cognition.
It blurs the line between the cognitive properties of systems composed of individuals manipulating
tools and the cognitive properties of individual minds,
which can cause to over-ascribing problems to an individual.

We should look at the artifacts as cultural and the individual as a member of a larger group of
individuals.

Individuals and their environment make intelligence.

Environmental perspectives emphasize cognition as embodied, enculturated, situated in local
interactions, and distributed across cultural artifacts.

Cognitive and cultural processes are intertwined. Cognition is an emergent property of interactions

Unit of analysis should be a cognitive system composed of individuals and cultural artifacts,
not one person.

The propagation of representation states is achieved by human and artifact components.

Interdependency between people and the artifacts they use.

## Representation

Problem-solving for distributed cognition is representing a problem
so that the solution is transparent.

### Distributed Representations

Perceptual processing of external information may be more efficient than internal processing.

## Interaction: propagation by coordination

A cognitive system achieves tasks by transforming and propagating representations across
representational medias. 
In interacting with artifacts, the people in a cognitive system provide
internal representations that are required to coordinate the observable representations in solving
the problem.

Epistemic actions are those
that enable humans to make use of environmental structures or create structures
that link with internal structures so that there is a coordinated interplay between internal and
external representations. 
The frequent rotating and movement of pieces is tetris is a type of this
epistemic action, because it does not help the player win but helps them think or understand.

Coordination is an emergent property, achieved through pragmatic and epistemic actions.
