# How do Design and Evaluation Interrelate in HCI Research?

This paper aims to propose and identify seven clusters of design work/research authorship.

HCI is defined as the discipline concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems
for human use and with the study of the major phenomenon surrounded them.

Design and evaluation should not be separated—they are related, and we need to understand that.

## HCI

HCI combines many different fields: the main points are:

1. Prototyping and iterative development from software eng
2. Software psychology and human factors of computing systems
3. UI from computer graphics
4. Models, theories, frameworks from cognitive science

Usability design is the main goal that drives both design and evaluation!

## Usability Design and Evaluation Methods

### Design Methods

1. At first, the focus was on system theory and software engineering

2. Then, on user participation, communication

3. Use oriented design methods—focus on the actual situations of using a tool. The prototype becomes iterative.

#### Participatory Design

Workplace democracy and human development EW the focus. The importance of active and creative participation by end-users
in the design process and cooperating with designers.

#### UCD

User Centered Design focused on the needs and interests of the user. UCD is less participatory than PD

#### Interaction Design

Method for designing interactive products to support people in their everyday life.

4 stages:

1. Identify needs and establish requirements
2. Develop alternative design
3. Build interactive designs
4. Evaluate designs

Interaction design:

1. Focuses on the user
2. Iterates
3. Identifies, documents, and agrees upon specific usability and user experience

### Evaluation Methods

Four modes:

1. Automatically - done with programs
2. Empirically - users assess the usability of an interface
3. Formally - exact models and formulas to calculate measures
4. Informally - rules of thumb used to evaluate usability

#### Informal or Inspection-based Evaluation

Nielsen's usability inspections (UIM) - non-empirical methods for evaluating interfaces. Can do heuristic evaluation,
cognitive walkthroughs, pluralistic walkthroughs, feature inspection, usability reviews, etc.

#### Formal or model-based

Can use the GOMS method.

#### Empirical or User-based evaluation

Verbal reports, surveys, walkthroughs, think-aloud methods count as empirical. It still does not ensure usability.

## Analysis

Because software and the world are always changing, we need to be able to iterate. Design and evaluation should be
evolutionary.

Design and evaluation go hand-in-hand, but are treated and separated often.

### Bibliometrics

#### ACA—Author Co-Citation Analysis

ACA analyzes the frequency with which pairs of authors appear with one another in citations

#### Seven clusters of authors
1. Participatory Design—focus on a better workplace and democracy. users and designers actively participate and
   cooperate in the design process
2. Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) - build systems to enable and enhance collaboration
3. User-Centered Design - build with a focus on users
4. Cognitive Engineering - cognitive properties of people and how those properties influence interactions
5. Cognitive Theories and Models understand the users, how they accomplish tasks, and why they think something is
   usable
6. Design Theory and Complexity
7. Design Rationale

## Conclusion
Design/Evaluation are not split. Cognitive theories and methods as the center of HCI.

It is likely that the next hot topic in HCI will be understanding design in the context of use. In-situ observation.
