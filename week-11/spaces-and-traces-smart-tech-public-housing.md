# Spaces and Traces: Implications of Smart Technology in Public Housing

Unique focus on low-income and multifamily settings.

Rather than designing technology that replaces human intelligence, the goal of a smart home should be offering resources
to act and think.

## Seniors in Public Housing
Seniors living in public housing have their own issues, and may not have any care.

## Methods
Participatory design workshops. Mitigated bias by splitting management from the residents.

## Findings

### Tracking and Monitoring

Health and wellness monitoring.

### Boundaries of Personal and Public Privacy

Still issues with recording, lack of trust, and feelings of concerns about independence.

Privacy concerns because of recording? the boundaries of public vs private space made this harder

### Shifting Baselines

As tech changes, we may need to do things differently and shift the expectations—like if smart devices are going to be
common in public housing, maybe the internet should be free?

## Conclusion

Need:

1. Hard decisions about tracking—it helps, but it can hurt too
2. Self-determination in data and use - residents should get to decide.
3. From endpoint to infrastructure, basic amenities should be part of a broader supportive ecosystem of public housing,
   rather than a set of individual consumption behaviors.
