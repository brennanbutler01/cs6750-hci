# Towards a framework for integrating Agile Development and UCD

Both HCI and Agile development emphasize the user.

## UCD

UCD places the user at the center of the design process.

## UCD and Agile

Similarities:

1. Both are iterative
2. Both emphasize the user
3. Both emphasize team coherence

Differences:

1. Agile doesn't like documentation, while UCD wants to support communication with developers and believes in some
   documentation.
2. UCD encourages the team to understand their users and do research, while Agile wants to jump into development.

## Fieldwork

Some groups felt like designers should be a sprint or week or so ahead of the developers.

## Results

4 themes:

1. User involvement
2. Collaboration and culture
3. Prototyping
4. Project lifecycle

### User Involvement

Every group (there were three) involved user feedback.

### Collaboration and Culture

Designers and developers fought and didn't get along well.

## Thoughts about how things went

Struggles between designers and developers throughout. Developers take longer to prototype than designers.

## Five Principles for better integration

1. User involvement - user should be involved, but supported by other roles in the team.
2. Collaboration and Culture - designers and developers have to work together, and the customer should be an active
   participant
3. Prototyping—designers must feed the developers to work
4. Project Lifecycle—UCD practitioners must be given time to discuss user needs
5. Project management - need a PM framework to facilitate without being overly constrictive.

We need to ensure that:

1. balance between engineering and design teams and needs
2. Resource management and project management
3. all members of the project should be available and involved at all points
4. The user should play a part in the project
