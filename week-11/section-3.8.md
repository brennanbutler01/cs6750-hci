# Section 3.8—Intro to conclusion to methods

## Designing Audiobook

Start through the design process: From needfinding -> design alternatives -> prototyping -> evaluation of three
low-fidelity prototypes
and then return to needfinding. After needfinding again, move onto design alternatives and then prototyping. Evaluate
again, and get more empirical as we go. Start doing some of the quantitative analysis.

Nested feedback cycles and iterative improvements are part of the design process, never stop improving.

## Methods meet design principles

Design principles capture conclusions.

1. Needfinding
    - Human needs—Human abilities—drives needs
    - Task analysis—describe human needs in formal ways
    - cognitive load—keep in mind user's load
2. Design alternatives
    - direct manipulation
    - mental models—understanding of how design alternatives mesh with understanding of a task
    - distributed cognition allows us to design for a larger level of granularity
3. Prototyping
    - Design principle rules of thumb for creating designs
    - Representations - ensures prototypes match mental models
    - Interfaces—Invisible Interfaces—interface as conduit
4. Evaluation
    - Feedback Cycles—ways to evaluate and describe interfaces
    - Politics and Values go beyond just usability
    - Usability heuristics - evaluate and mentally simulate

## UCD Approaches

More extreme approaches:

1. Participatory design - all the stakeholders (users too) are part of the design team. User perspective
   omni-present. Don't over-represent one person's view.

2. Action Research - address immediate problem and simultaneously try to solve it. Undertaken by actual users.

3. Design-based research can be done by outside practitioners. Designers create interventions based on their current
   understanding of the theory or problem, and use those findings to improve them.
