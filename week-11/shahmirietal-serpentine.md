# Shahmirietal Serpentine

Serpentine is a self-powered chord sensor that allows a lot of novel input methods.

## Prototype

### Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG)

Teng allows self-generation of power.

### Sensor Operation

Interactions with the chord can be separated into two parts: contact from human skin and elongation along the
cylindrical axis of the chord.

Can use the following interactions:
1. Double pinch
2. Twirl
3. Pluck
4. Stretch
5. Twist
6. Wiggle

## Applications

Three application scenarios:
1. Hoodie string controller to replace headphones, control phone calls, texts, etc.
2. Expressive switch to be deployed as a simple device controller.
3. Slingshot game controller - pluck the string

## Future Work

Make a power harvester and generate more fully self-sustaining solutions.
