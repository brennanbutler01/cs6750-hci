# Section 3.7—HCI and Agile Development

## Intro to Agile Methods

Agile emphasis CI, rapid feedback, and quick development.

## The Demand for Rapid HCI

It used to be much harder to build, ship, and test software. Now it is much easier, so we can do
things iteratively.

Now we can also get a lot of feedback for free and easily, without extra work on our own.

High stake, high-tech products, hardware, etc. still require the old way of doing things slowly.

## When to do agile?

1. When criticality is low (not many safety or security risks).
2. When requirements change frequently.
3. Small team that is comfortable with change.

## Paper Spotlight

Both agile and UCD are iterative and feature multiple rounds. Both place emphasis on team coherence
and THE USER.

UCD and agile disagree on the importance of documentation and the importance of research.

Five principles for integration:

1. User involvement
2. Collaboration and culture
3. prototyping
4. Project lifecycle
5. Project management

## Live Prototyping

Creating actual interfaces is almost as easy as creating a prototype now using some low or no-code
tools.

We still need to get feedback...

## A/B Testing

We still want to test our interfaces before actually showing users... so we should do rapid a/b
testing (two alternatives - like T tests).

Rapidly test small changes with real users. Roll b out to small # of users, and check if anything
goes wrong before rolling it out to everyone.

Test with real users during real usage. Feature flags to do this.

Allows rapid iteration and feedback.

## Agile HCI in the Design Life Cycle

We still do all the same processes in our design life cycle when doing agile, we just do it
faster—do different types of prototypes and different evaluation methods.

We still may want to do an initial, normal need-finding phase.

Mitigating risk:

1. Start traditional, and then switch to agile after you have something solid and have done finding.
2. Focus on small changes to existing interfaces, not building a new site from scratch.
3. Adopt a parallel track method— the research can be one sprint ahead of the implementation.
4. Be careful with consistency—don't mess with expectations too often, or users may not like it
5. Nest design cycles—small design cycles, rapid with tiny bits of information. Use the
   information that you gather in a larger, more traditional design cycle that incorporates the
   feedback and goes beyond just little optimizations.

Have a high cost of failure? Need hardware? Avoid agile.
